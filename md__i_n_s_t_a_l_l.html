<h1>Overall summary </h1>
<p>GalSim is a python module that has much of its implementation in C++ for improved computational efficiency. GalSim supports both Python 2 and Python 3. It is regularly tested on Python versions (2.7, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6).</p>
<p>The usual way to install GalSim is now (starting with version 2.0) simply </p><pre class="fragment">pip install galsim
</pre><p>which will install the latest official release of GalSim.</p>
<p>Note that you may need to use sudo with the above command if you are installing into system directories. If you do not have write privileges for the directory it is trying to install into, you can use the &ndash;user flag to install into a local directory instead. (Normally something like $HOME/Library/Python/2.7 or $HOME/.local, depending on your system.)</p>
<p>This might fail if certain libraries are installed in non-standard locations. In this case, add the paths for these libraries to both the LIBRARY_PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH environmental variables before running pip: </p><pre class="fragment">export LIBRARY_PATH=$LIBARY_PATH:/path/to/lib:/other/path/to/lib
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/path/to/lib:/other/path/to/lib
</pre><p>If you would rather install from source (e.g. to work on a development branch), you can do </p><pre class="fragment">git clone git@github.com:GalSim-developers/GalSim.git
cd GalSim
pip install -r requirements.txt
python setup.py install
</pre><p>(again possibly with either sudo or &ndash;user).</p>
<p><b>Note</b>: If you use Anaconda Python, you can use that to install most of the requirements with their conda installer. See [Using Conda](using-conda) below.</p>
<p>Either of these installation methods should handle most of the required dependencies for you if you do not have them already installed on your machine. There is one exception, however. FFTW is not directly pip installable, so if the above installation fails, you may need to install it separately. See section 2 below for more details about how to do this.</p>
<p>The other dependencies should all be installed by pip, but we list them here for completeness along with versions that are known to work. In most cases, other recent (especially later) versions will also work:</p>
<ul>
<li>Eigen (3.2.5)</li>
<li>NumPy (1.13.1)</li>
<li>Future (0.16.0)</li>
<li>Astropy (2.0.1)</li>
<li>PyBind11 (2.2.1)</li>
<li>LSSTDESC.Coord (1.0.5)</li>
</ul>
<p>There are a few others modules are not technically required, but we let pip install them along with GalSim, because they either add useful functionality or efficiency to GalSim. These are listed in the requirements.txt file that pip uses to determine what else to install. But if you install with <code>python setup.py install</code>, then these will not be installed.</p>
<ul>
<li>Starlink (3.10.0) (Improved WCS functionality)</li>
<li>PyYaml (3.12) (Reads YAML config files)</li>
<li>Pandas (0.20) (Faster reading of ASCII input files)</li>
</ul>
<h1>Installing FFTW </h1>
<p>GalSim uses FFTW (The Fastest Fourier Transform in the West) for performing fast fourier transforms.</p>
<p>We require FFTW version &gt;= 3.0. Most tests have been done with FFTW 3.3.7, so if you have trouble with an earlier version, try upgrading to 3.3.7 or later.</p>
<h2>i) Installing FFTW yourself </h2>
<p>FFTW is available at the URL </p><pre class="fragment">http://www.fftw.org/download.html
</pre><p>As of this writing, version 3.3.7 is the current latest release, for which the following commands should work to download and install it: </p><pre class="fragment">wget http://www.fftw.org/fftw-3.3.7.tar.gz
tar xfz fftw-3.3.7.tar.gz
cd fftw-3.3.7
./configure --enable-shared
make
sudo make install
</pre><p>If you want to install into a different directory (e.g. because you do not have sudo privileges on your machine), then specify the alternate directory with the &ndash;prefix flag to configure. E.g. </p><pre class="fragment">./configure --enable-shared --prefix=$HOME
</pre><p>which will install the library into $HOME/lib and the header file into $HOME/include. In this case, leave off the sudo from the last line. Also, you should make sure these directories are in your LD_LIBRARY_PATH and C_INCLUDE_PATH environment variables, respectively.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if you do not want to modify your LD_LIBRARY_PATH and/or C_INCLUDE_PATH, you can instead set an environment variable to tell GalSim where the files are </p><pre class="fragment">export FFTW_DIR=/path/to/fftw/prefix
</pre><p>E.g. in the above case where prefix is $HOME, you would do </p><pre class="fragment">export FFTW_DIR=$HOME
</pre><p>Probably, you should put this into your shell login file (e.g. .bash_profile) so it always gets set when you log in.</p>
<h2>ii) Using an existing installation of FFTW </h2>
<p>If FFTW is already installed on your system, there may be nothing to do. If it is in a standard location like /usr/local/lib or in some other directory in your LD_LIBRARY_PATH, then GalSim should find it without any extra work on your part.</p>
<p>If it is in a non-standard location, and you do not want to add this path to your LD_LIBRARY_PATH (or you are on a modern Mac that hides such system variables from setup.py), then you can instead set the FFTW_DIR environment variable to tell GalSim where to look </p><pre class="fragment">export FFTW_DIR=/some/path/to/fftw
</pre><p>For instance, if libfftw3.so is located in /opt/cray/pe/lib64, you could use that with </p><pre class="fragment">export FFTW_DIR=/opt/cray/pe/lib64
</pre><p>This command would normally be done in your .bash_profile file so it gets executed every time you log in.</p>
<p>If you have multiple versions of FFTW installed on your system, this variable can be used to specify which version you want GalSim to use as this will be the first location it will check during the installation process.</p>
<h2>iii) Installing FFTW with conda </h2>
<p>If you use conda, FFTW can be install with </p><pre class="fragment">conda install fftw
</pre><p>This will put it into the anaconda/lib directory on your system (within your active environment if appropriate). GalSim knows to look here, so there is nothing additional you need to do.</p>
<h2>iv) Installing FFTW with apt-get </h2>
<p>On Linux machines that use apt-get, FFTW can be installed with </p><pre class="fragment">apt-get install libfftw3-dev
</pre><h2>v) Installing FFTW with fink </h2>
<p>If you use fink on a Mac, FFTW can be installed with </p><pre class="fragment">fink install fftw3
</pre><p>(Make sure to use fftw3, not fftw, since fftw is version 2.)</p>
<p>This will put it into the /sw/lib directory on your system. GalSim knows to look here, so there is nothing additional you need to do.</p>
<h2>vi) Installing FFTW with MacPorts </h2>
<p>If you use MacPorts, FFTW can be installed with </p><pre class="fragment">port install fftw-3
</pre><p>This will put it into the /opt/local/lib directory on your system. GalSim knows to look here, so there is nothing additional you need to do.</p>
<h1>Installing Eigen </h1>
<p>GalSim uses Eigen for the C++-layer linear algebra calculations. It is a header-only library, which means that nothing needs to be compiled to use it. You can download the header files yourself, but if you do not, then we use the pip-installable eigency module, which bundles the header files in their installed python directory. So usually, this dependency should require no work on your part.</p>
<p>However, it might become useful to install Eigen separately from eigency e.g. if you want to upgrade to a newer version of Eigen than the one that is bundled with eigency. (Eigen 3.2.8 is bundled with eigency 1.77.) Therefore, this section describes several options for how to obtain and install Eigen.</p>
<p>We require Eigen version &gt;= 3.0. Most tests have been done with Eigen 3.2.8 or 3.3.4, but we have also tested on 3.0.4, so probably any 3.x version will work. However, if you have trouble with another version, try upgrading to 3.2.8 or later.</p>
<p>Note: Prior to version 2.0, GalSim used TMV for the linear algebra back end. This is still an option if you prefer (e.g. it may be faster for some use cases, since it can use an optimized BLAS library on your system), but to use TMV, you need to use the SCons installation option described below.</p>
<h2>i) Installing Eigen yourself </h2>
<p>Eigen is available at the URL </p><pre class="fragment">http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php
</pre><p>As of this writing, version 3.3.4 is the current latest release, for which the following commands should work to download and install it: </p><pre class="fragment">wget http://bitbucket.org/eigen/eigen/get/3.3.4.tar.bz2
tar xfj 3.3.4.tar.bz2
sudo cp eigen-eigen-5a0156e40feb/Eigen /usr/local/include
</pre><p>In the final cp line, the MD5 hash (5a0156e40feb) will presumably change for other versions, so use whatever directory tar expands into if you are using a different version than 3.3.4.</p>
<p>If you do not have sudo privileges, you can copy to a different directory such as $HOME/include instead and leave off the sudo from the cp command. In this case, make sure this directory is in your C_INCLUDE_PATH environment variable.</p>
<p>Finally, you can also skip the last command above and instead set EIGEN_DIR as an environment variable to tell GalSim where the files are </p><pre class="fragment">export EIGEN_DIR=/some/path/to/eigen
</pre><p>This should be the directory in which the Eigen subdirectory is found. E.g. </p><pre class="fragment">export EIGEN_DIR=$HOME/eigen-eigen-5a0156e40feb
</pre><p>Probably, you should put this into your .bash_profile file so it always gets set when you log in.</p>
<h2>ii) Using an existing installation of Eigen </h2>
<p>If Eigen is already installed on your system, there may be nothing to do. If it is in a standard location like /usr/local/include or in some other directory in your C_INCLUDE_PATH, then GalSim should find it without any extra work on your part.</p>
<p>If it is in a non-standard location, and you do not want to add this path to your C_INCLUDE_PATH, then you can instead set the EIGEN_DIR environment variable to tell GalSim where to look </p><pre class="fragment">export EIGEN_DIR=/some/path/to/eigen
</pre><p>For instance, if Eigen was installed into /usr/include/eigen3, then you could use that with </p><pre class="fragment">export EIGEN_DIR=/usr/include/eigen3
</pre><p>This command would normally be done in your .bash_profile file so it gets executed every time you log in.</p>
<p>If you have multiple versions of Eigen installed on your system, this variable can be used to specify which version you want GalSim to use as this will be the first location it will check during the installation process.</p>
<h2>iii) Installing Eigen with conda </h2>
<p>If you use conda, Eigen can be install with </p><pre class="fragment">conda install eigen
</pre><p>This will put it into the anaconda/include directory on your system (within your active environment if appropriate). GalSim knows to look here, so there is nothing additional you need to do.</p>
<h2>iv) Installing Eigen with apt-get </h2>
<p>On Linux machines that use apt-get, Eigen can be installed with </p><pre class="fragment">apt-get install libeigen3-dev
</pre><h2>v) Installing Eigen with fink </h2>
<p>If you use fink on a Mac, Eigen can be installed with </p><pre class="fragment">fink install eigen
</pre><p>This will put it into the /sw/include directory on your system. GalSim knows to look here, so there is nothing additional you need to do.</p>
<h2>vi) Installing Eigen with MacPorts </h2>
<p>If you use MacPorts, Eigen can be installed with </p><pre class="fragment">port install eigen
</pre><p>This will put it into the /opt/local/include directory on your system. GalSim knows to look here, so there is nothing additional you need to do.</p>
<h2>vii) Using eigency </h2>
<p>Eigency is a pip-installable module that bundles the Eigen header files, so it can also be used to install these files on your system. Indeed, as mentioned above, we will use eigency automatically if Eigen is not found in one of the above locations. So the above installations will take precendence, but eigency should work as a fall-back.</p>
<p>Note: At the time of this writing, installation of eigency depends on having cython already installed. I thought I fixed this with PR #26, but it was not quite complete. There is now an open PR #27, which I believe will finish making pip install eigency work, even if you do not have cython installed. But for now, you need to do </p><pre class="fragment">pip install cython
pip install eigency
</pre><p>(in that order) for it to work.</p>
<h1>Using Conda </h1>
<p>If you use conda (normally via the Anaconda Python distribution), then all of the prerequisites are available from the conda-forge channel, so you can use that as follows (from within the main GalSim directory): </p><pre class="fragment">conda create -y -n galsim
conda activate galsim
conda install -y -c conda-forge --file conda_requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install .
</pre><p>The first two lines are optional, but they let you keep the GalSim installation separate from any other conda environments you might have.</p>
<p>If your conda version is 4.3 or earlier, replace the above conda activate line with </p><pre class="fragment">source activate galsim
</pre><p>which does the same thing. They just changed the name of this command to use the conda executable instead of source.</p>
<p>Also, if you prefer to use the defaults channel, then (at least as of this writing), it had all the items in conda_requirements.txt, except for pybind11. So if you have conda-forge in your list of channels, but it comes after defaults, then that should still work and pybind11 will be the only one that will need the conda-forge channel.</p>
<h1>Installing With SCons </h1>
<p>Prior to version 2.0, GalSim installation used SCons. This installation mode is still supported, but is not recommended unless you have difficulties with the setup.py installation.</p>
<p>Note: Two options that are available with the SCons installation method, but not the setup.py method, are (1) using TMV instead of Eigen for the linear algebra back end, and (2) using Boost.Python instead of PyBind11 for the wrapping the C++ code to be called from Python. If you need either of these options, then you should use the SCons installation.</p>
<p>See the file INSTALL_SCONS.md for complete details about this method of installation.</p>
<h1>Running tests </h1>
<p>You can run our test suite by typing </p><pre class="fragment">python setup.py test
</pre><p>This should run all the python-layer tests with pytest and also compile and run the C++ test suite.</p>
<p>There are a number of packages that are used by the tests, but which are not required for GalSim installation and running. These should be installed automatically by the above command, but you can install them manually via </p><pre class="fragment">pip install -r test_requirements.txt
</pre><p>(As usually, you may need to add either <code>sudo</code> or <code>--user</code>.)</p>
<p>By default, the tests will run in parallel using the pytest plugins <code>pytest-xdist</code> and <code>pytest-timeout</code> (to manage how much time each test is allowed to run). If you want to run the python tests in serial instead, you can do this via </p><pre class="fragment">python setup.py test -j1
</pre><p>You can also use this to modify how many jobs will be spawned for running the tests.</p>
<p><b>Note</b>: If your system does not have <code>pytest</code> installed, and you do not want to install it, you can run all the Python tests with the script run_all_tests in the <code>tests</code> directory. If this finishes without an error, then all the tests have passed. However, note that this script runs more tests than our normal test run using pytest, so it may take quite a while to finish. (The <em>all</em> in the file name means run all the tests including the slow ones that we normally skip.)</p>
<h1>Running example scripts </h1>
<p>The <code>examples</code> directory has a series of demo scripts: </p><pre class="fragment">demo1.py, demo2.py, ...
</pre><p>These can be considered a tutorial on getting up to speed with GalSim. Reading through these in order will introduce you to how to use most of the features of GalSim in Python. To run these scripts, type (e.g.): </p><pre class="fragment">python demo1.py
</pre><p>There are also a corresponding set of config files: </p><pre class="fragment">demo1.yaml, demo2.yaml, ...
</pre><p>These files can be run using the executable <code>galsim</code>, and will produce the same output images as the Python scripts: </p><pre class="fragment">galsim demo1.yaml
</pre><p>They are also well commented, and can be considered a parallel tutorial for learning the config file usage of GalSim.</p>
<p>All demo scripts are designed to be run in the <code>GalSim/examples</code> directory. Some of them access files in subdirectories of the <code>examples</code> directory, so they would not work correctly from other locations. </p>
